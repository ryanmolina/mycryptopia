= Bitcoin and Altcoin Wallets FREE plugin overview =

This is the *core plugin* that takes care of *basic accounting functionality*:

- **Accounting for your users.** Data is held on tables in your MySQL database.
- **A financial transaction [PHP API](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/php-api/)**:
  Calls that let the logged in user handle their cryptocurrencies.
- **A [JSON API](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/json-api/)**: JSON requests of the above, for logged in users.
- **[Simple shortcodes](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/shortcodes/)**:
  These let you display frontend UI elements to let logged-in users perform the following common tasks:
  - deposit from the blockchain,
  - withdraw to an external blockchain address,
  - transfer funds to other users (on-site transactions that bypass the blockchain),
  - view a history of past transactions
- **Widgets** the same UI elements available via shortcodes can also be used as widgets in your theme.
- Configure who has a wallet and who does what using WordPress capabilities.
- Configure e-mail notifications for users.
- Configure e-mail confirmations for transactions and optionally confirm transactions via the admin interface.
- **Backup and restore transactions**: An **import/export** functionality to backup transactions to and from [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files.
- **Extensible architecture**
  - Easily install coin adapter plugins to use other cryprocurrencies besides Bitcoin.
  - Easily install extension plugins that talk to the PHP API to provide additional functionality such as payment gateways.

== Installation ==

As a new user, you should first read the glossary section of the documentation to familiarize yourself with some basic concepts. The troubleshooting section for the main plugin is also found in the documentation. The support forum for the main plugin is at [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wallets), but please first read [this notice](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/important-please-read-before-posting-an-issue/) before posting.

First, understand the tradeoff between setting up a full node or using the cloud wallets.

= Full node =

If you are interested in installing a **full node**, then follow the instructions in the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dbkKHhEzRQ). A full node is harder to setup and maintain, but gives you performance and freedom to control network fee settings.

= Cloud wallets =

**Cloud wallets** on the other hand are easier to use and provide more coins, but are somewhat slower, and you rely on a third party service.
  - If you are interested in installing the CoinPayments adapter, then the installation instructions are on the [coin adapter page](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/coinpayments-adapter-extension/).
  - If you prefer to install the block.io coin adapter then the installation instructions are on that other [coin adapter page](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/block-io-cloud-wallet-adapter-extension/).

There is a troubleshooting section on the coin adapter pages.

The support forums are [here](https://www.dashed-slug.net/forums/forum/coinpayments-net-coin-adapter-extension-support/) and [here](https://www.dashed-slug.net/forums/forum/block-io-cloud-wallet-adapter-extension-support/).

= Disclaimer =

**By using this free plugin you accept all responsibility for handling the account balances for all your users.**
Under no circumstances is **dashed-slug.net** or any of its affiliates responsible for any damages incurred by the use of this plugin.

Every effort has been made to harden the security of this plugin, but its safe operation depends on your site being secure overall.
You, the site administrator, must take all necessary precautions to secure your WordPress installation before you connect it to any live wallets.

You are strongly advised to take the following actions (at a minimum):

- [educate yourself about hardening WordPress security](https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress)
- [install a security plugin such as Wordfence](https://infinitewp.com/addons/wordfence/)
- **Enable SSL on your site** if you have not already done so.

By continuing to use the Bitcoin and Altcoin Wallets plugin, you indicate that you have understood and agreed to this disclaimer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which coins are currently available? =

The list of wallets that you can connect to directly is constantly growing.

To check whatâ€™s currently available go to https://www.dashed-slug.net and check the menu under *Wallets* &rarr; *Coin Adapter Extensions* and see the available RPC adapters.

Also, if you are OK with using a web wallet service, then you can install the [CoinPayments adapter](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/coinpayments-adapter-extension/). You then automatically get [all of the coins that platform supports](https://www.coinpayments.net/supported-coins/).

= Is it secure? =

The [Bitcoin and Altcoin Wallets](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/) plugin is only as secure as your WordPress installation. Regardless of whether you choose to install this plugin, you should have already taken steps to secure your WordPress installation. At a minimum you should do the following:

- Install a security plugin such as [Wordfence](https://infinitewp.com/addons/wordfence/).
- Read the Codex resources on [Hardening WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Hardening_WordPress).
- If you are connecting to an RPC API on a different machine than that of your WordPress server over an untrusted network,
  make sure to tunnel your connection via `ssh` or `stunnel`. [See here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Enabling_SSL_on_original_client_daemon).

= Do I really need to run a full node? bitcoind is too resource-hungry for my server. =

Running a full node requires you to set up the daemon on a VPS or other machine that you own and administer. Normally the full blockchain needs to be downloaded, so you need to make sure that your server can handle the disk and network requirements.

**Cloud wallets**

Instead, you can choose to install one of the available coin adapters that are backed by cloud wallet services. These currently are:

- The [CoinPayments Adapter extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/coinpayments-adapter-extension/)
- The [block.io Cloud Wallet Adapter extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/block-io-cloud-wallet-adapter-extension/)

Study the services and their terms of service including what fees they charge before choosing to use them.

**bittiraha**

From version 1.1.0 onward, this plugin is compatible with the [bittiraha-walletd](https://github.com/prasos/bittiraha-walletd) wallet. From the project's description on GitHub:

> Lightweight Bitcoin RPC compatible HD wallet
> This project is meant as a drop-in replacement for bitcoind for use in lightweight servers.

This is a wallet based on `bitcoinj` and does not store the blockchain locally. You will have to install this on a VPS or other server via the shell.

A downside is that the `walletnotify` mechanism and the `listtransactions` command are not implemented. **This means that there is no easy way for the plugin to be notified of deposits.** Deposits will not be recorded in the transactions table. Users will not be emailed when they perform deposits and they will not be able to see their deposits in the `[wallets_transactions]` UI. Deposits will correctly affect users' balances. You have been warned.

**Electrum**

Alternatively, you can install and configure an [Electrum wallet](https://electrum.org) and the [Electrum Bitcoin RPC Adapter extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/electrum-bitcoin-rpc-adapter-extension/). **Don't forget to disable the built-in Bitcoin core adapter.**

= Can you install/configure the plugin for me? / I am having trouble with the bitcoin.conf file =

I am available to answer any specific questions if you attempt to install the plugin and you face some problem. Unfortunately I do not undertake installation and configuration of the plugin.

Keep in mind that no software is set-and-forget. Once you install software, it then needs to be maintained. If you find that you are having trouble installing the plugin or connecting it to a wallet, even with help, this is a good indication that you should not be running a wallet with people's money on it.

Remember that you have two options: stand-alone wallets or web wallets. Running a web wallet is considerably easier than a stand-alone wallet, as it does not require system administration skills. As a general rule, if you have trouble using Linux from the command line, you will be better off installing a web wallet.

= I cannot connect to a wallet running on my home computer =

Unless your home internet connection has a static IP and you have opened the correct ports on your router/firewall you will not be able to use your home computer as a wallet backend. In fact, this is not a very good idea. Ideally you need a dedicated server to run a wallet with the availability required by a site that serves multiple users. Virtual private servers (VPSs) should be OK as the wallets do not max-out CPU usage under normal operation, after the blockchain finishes syncing. Shared/managed hosting plans are not appropriate for running wallet daemons. If you have a shared/managed hosting plan (i.e. no ssh access), you are stuck with using web wallets.

Check with your hosting plan for disk space and memory requirements against the requirements of the wallet you wish to run. For Bitcoin core, click [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/requirements).

= How can I integrate the plugin with my site? =

Just insert the [shortcodes](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/wallet-shortcodes/) anywhere to create forms to let a logged in user:

- **deposit funds:** `[wallets_deposit]`
- **withdraw funds:** `[wallets_withdraw]`
- **transfer funds to other users:** `[wallets_move]`
- **view their balance:** `[wallets_balance]`
- **view past transactions:** `[wallets_transactions]`

These shortcodes render [knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)-enabled forms. Read the shortcodes documentation for more details.

You can enter the same UI elements into your theme's widget area.
Simply go to *Appearance* &rarr; *Widgets* and use the provided front-end widgets.

You can also use a special menu item to display the user balances as part of a nav menu. See the *Frontend* section of the documentation for details.


= I donâ€™t like the built-in forms. Can I change them or provide my own? =

1. First of all, the forms can be styled with CSS. They have convenient HTML classes that you can use.

2. If you wish to translate the form texts to a different language, see the *Localization* section of this manual.

3. If you wish to change the texts to something else, you may use the `wallets_ui_text_*` WordPress filters.

4. If you wish to create forms with completely different markup, you can provide your own views for these shortcodes.
Use the `wallets_views_dir` filter to override the directory where the views are stored (the default is `wallets/includes/views`).
Most people will not need to do this.

Read the *Shortcodes* section of this manual for more details.

= I want to do transactions from JavaScript. I donâ€™t want to use the provided shortcodes and their associated forms. =

The provided built-in forms talk to a JSON API that is available to logged in users.
If you choose to build your own front-end UI, you can do your AJAX calls directly to the JSON API.

Refer to the [JSON API documentation](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/json-api/) for details.

= I want to do transactions from the PHP code of my theme or plugin. =

You can use the PHP API directly.

Refer to the [PHP API documentation](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/php-api/) for details.

= I want to replace an adapter with another one. =

You can only have one coin adapter enabled per each coin. The plugin will warn you about this. To replace the adapter for a coin with a new adapter:

1. Deactivate the old adapter.
2. Install and configure the new adapter.
3. Enable the new adapter.
4. Got to *Wallets* &rarr; *Adapters*. Under the new adapter, select *Renew deposit addresses*. This will renew any user deposit addresses, as well as the cold storage deposit address for that coin.

= Can you add XYZ coin for me? =

Unfortunately no. I can no longer cater to requests to add new coin adapters. I can only provide assistance by answering specific questions to coin adapter developers.

If your coin's wallet has a standard RPC API that is a direct fork of Bitcoin core, then you should be able to modify the [Litecoin adapter](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/litecoin-adapter-extension/) to suite your needs. Feel free to republish it after modifying the code. There are some instructions on how to do this [here](https://www.dashed-slug.net/developers-coin-adapters-api/). More detailed instructions are in the PDF documentation, under the section *Coin Adapter development*.

If your coin is an ERC-20 token then there is no support for that at the moment. Ideally this is something that will be implemented in the future.

= Are you available for custom development work? =

Unfortunately I do not undertake custom projects. If you have an idea about a cool extension then please let me know about it. If it is a good fit for the project, it will be added to the backlog. When implemented, It will be available either to all users for free, or for dashed-slug premium members.

= Can you add fiat currency deposits? =

I do not have plans to add fiat currency deposits. That is not to say that someone cannot develop an extension to do this.

= Can you build an exchange on top of the plugin? =

Yes this is in the future plans, but it is a huge undertaking! For now you can use the [ShapeShift app extension](https://www.dashed-slug.net/bitcoin-altcoin-wallets-wordpress-plugin/shapeshift-extension/) that lets you display a front-end UI to the [ShapeShift.io](https://shapeshift.io/) service.

= I want to pay for premium membership but cannot or do not want to pay via PayPal. =

I am currently in the process of building a plugin extension that will allow you to pay for membership via cryptocurrencies.
In the meantime, you may contact me directly at [info@dashed-slug.net](mailto:info@dashed-slug.net) if you wish to send a Bitcoin payment and I will activate your membership manually.

= How can I get support or submit feedback? =

Please use the [support forum on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wallets) for all issues and inquiries regarding the plugin.

To get support on the provided extensions, subscribe to dashed-slug and go to the [support forums](https://www.dashed-slug.net/support/).

For all other communication, please contact [info@dashed-slug.net](mailto:info@dashed-slug.net).
