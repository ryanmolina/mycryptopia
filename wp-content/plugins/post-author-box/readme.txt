A supremely customizable way to add information about the author at the top or bottom of a post, page, or other view.

== Description ==

Post Author Box allows you to append or prepend an informational box on any post, page, or other view without having to modify your theme. It has no opinions about what information is displayed or how it's presented. Configure the box with any of the following tokens:

* %display_name%
* %author_link%
* %author_posts_link%
* %first_name%
* %last_name%
* %description%
* %email%
* %avatar%
* %jabber%
* %aim%
* %post_date%
* %post_time%
* %post_modified_date%
* %post_modified_time%

You can use basic HTML and CSS for styling.
