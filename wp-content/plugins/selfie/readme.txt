Selfie: Native in-post text ads that your readers can purchase themselves.

== Description ==

**Demo:** http://youtu.be/O-W_dZw7Cwg

Your loyal readers are an untapped source of revenue. You will never know how
many potential advertisers are reading your site; until you try Selfie.

Selfie places one or more self-serve message widgets in your posts and pages
which let end readers post their own message to promote themselves â€” for a price
that you set, of course.

This is useful for:

* Classified-like ads
* Shout outs
* Promotion of a business or event

Just insert a Selfie anywhere in a Wordpress post or page by enabling automatic 
placement (default) or enter the **[selfie]** shortcode in a post.

**Pricing:** A 20% fee on Selfie purchases. There is a minimal adserving charge 
for large publishers only (those with close to 100k+ monthly page views).

Most users will never have to pay.
