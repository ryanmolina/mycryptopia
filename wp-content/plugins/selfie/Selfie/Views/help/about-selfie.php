Have you ever wanted to tell a lot of people about something at once? You know, when you're promoting something like a yard sale, your side businesses, or maybe even a shout out to someone for a special occasion like a birthday or anniversary?

Maybe you're a small business owner or a real estate agent, and you've got to get the word out about an event or property.

There's a new self serve advertising tool on <?php bloginfo('name') ?> that will let you do just that. It looks like this, which you may have seen in some articles recently:

[selfie]Give it a try! Click here and start typing. Don't buy this one though, because other readers need to try it too![/selfie]

Now you can send a message to all of the readers of a particular article in a very easy and cost-effective way. You can run a message for as little as a day, or for years.

Here is the basic pricing for running a message in an article<?php if(count($config->rules) > 0): ?>, but there are sometimes some specials in certain articles<?php endif; ?>:

<style>
    #selfie-pricing tr td {
        padding: 5px;
    }
</style>
<table id='selfie-pricing'>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>One Day</strong></td>
        <td style='padding: 5px;'>$<?php echo $config->price_day ?></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>One Week</strong></td>
        <td>$<?php echo $config->price_week ?></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>One Month</strong></td>
        <td>$<?php echo $config->price_month ?></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>One Year</strong></td>
        <td>$<?php echo $config->price_year ?></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Just click into the space and start typing your message. Then click the "post" button to finish up the steps. Once the editor of <?php bloginfo('name') ?> approves it, it will go live instantly. You'll even get a report of the number of people who saw your message at the end of the run.

<strong>Think about it!</strong> Maybe you've got a friend who has a business that you could help promote &minus; What a nice gesture! And while you're doing that, you're helping <?php bloginfo('name') ?> continue to be the best news source for the community.

It's great for:

<ul>
    <li>General shout outs for special occasions</li>
    <li>Promoting events</li>
    <li>Promoting real estate</li>
    <li>Getting more eyes on a Craigslist posting</li>
    <li>Promoting a business, which might even be related to the article</li>
    <li>Promoting your social media accounts, like Facebook or Twitter</li>
</ul>

We hope you give it a try! It was built for you.
