== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= Can I scrape any website? =


You can scrape content from almost every web site that you open in your browser. Just be sure that the content is not generated dynamically by javascript, such as load more buttons or lazy loading content by scrolling down.

You can check your website that you would like to scrape by disabling javascript from your browser settings and check if your content is still visible to you. Besides for serial type scraping make sure that a next page button is available and the content is not loading automatically on the current page.
